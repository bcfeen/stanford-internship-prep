# Weeks 4–5 – Bayesian Modeling

This folder focuses on applying Bayesian concepts to build simple models in Python.

Topics covered:
- Implementing real-world models
- Understanding model structure and priors
- Visualizing posteriors
- Intro to probabilistic logic before Pyro

Goal: Build intuition before diving into probabilistic programming libraries.
