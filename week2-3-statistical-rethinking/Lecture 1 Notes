Lecture 1 Notes

Key Concepts:
1. Statistical models = stories about how the world works
2. Bayesian models let you combine prior beliefs + data to update what you believe
3. Uncertainty is the point — not the enemy
4. A good model doesn’t “find the truth” — it helps us reason under uncertainty

Drawing the Bayesian Owl (5 Steps):
1. Theoretical estimand — What do you want to know?
2. Scientific (causal) model(s) — What do you believe causes what? (DAGs)
3. Build statistical model — Use 1 & 2 to set up a probability model
4. Simulate from Step 2 — Test if your model gets the right answer in a fake world
5. Analyze real data — Only after simulation, go test it with real data

DAGs (Directed Acyclic Graphs):
1. Visual maps of cause and effect
2. Arrows show direction of influence (e.g., A → B → C)
3. Help us decide what to control for when modeling
4. Force us to think about our assumptions

Questions:
1. How do you choose priors that aren’t totally arbitrary?
2. What if your DAG is wrong — how much does that affect your conclusions?
3. Why simulate fake data instead of just analyzing real data from the start?
